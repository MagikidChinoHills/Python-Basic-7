Homework Assignment: Mastering File Handling in Python

Objective: This assignment is designed to teach students how to read from and write to files using Python. Students will explore different methods for handling files, including text and binary files.

Problem 1: Reading and Writing Text Files

1. Write a Python script that reads the contents of a text file named `input.txt`. Print the content to the console.

2. Create a new text file named `output.txt`. Write a few lines of text to this file using the script.

3. Modify your script to read the contents of `output.txt` and print it to the console.

Problem 2: CSV File Handling

4. Create a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file named `data.csv` with some sample data. Include headers for columns.

5. Write a Python script that reads the content of `data.csv` and prints it in a formatted way. Utilize the `csv` module for handling CSV files.

6. Modify your script to append a new row of data to `data.csv`.

Problem 3: Binary File Handling

7. Write a Python script that reads an image file (e.g., a PNG or JPG file) and prints its size in bytes.

8. Create a new image file by copying the content of the original image file. Verify that the new file is an identical copy of the original.

Problem 4: JSON File Handling

9. Write a Python script that creates a dictionary with sample data.

10. Save the dictionary as a JSON file named `data.json`. Verify the content of the JSON file.

11. Modify your script to read the JSON file and print the data.


Additional Tips:

- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
