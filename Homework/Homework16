Practice Problem 1: Draw a Grid of Squares
Problem:
  Create a new function called draw_grid_of_squares(t, rows, cols, size) that draws a grid of squares using the draw_square function.
Requirements:
  The grid should be rows x cols in dimension.
  Each square should have side length size.
  Leave a small gap (e.g., 10 pixels) between squares.
  Make each square a random color from the existing colors list.

Practice Problem 2: Animate a Growing Spiral of Stars
Problem:
  Write a function called draw_spiral_stars(t, num_stars) that draws a spiral pattern using stars that gradually increase in size and rotate.
Requirements:
  Start from the center of the screen.
  Each star should be slightly larger and rotated more than the previous one.
  Change the color for each star randomly.
  Use t.forward() and t.right() to create the spiral effect.

Practice Problem 3: Add a New Shape â€“ Pentagon
Problem:
  Add a new function draw_pentagon(t, length) to draw a filled pentagon shape, then include it in the shape_functions list used by draw_random_art.
Requirements:
  Draw a regular 5-sided pentagon.
  Each side should be length units.
  Use the correct turning angle (72 degrees).
  Add the pentagon to the random shape drawing process in draw_random_art.


Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
