#Homework 5
#part 1:
#1.
#A list is a group of srung together strings, integers, flats, or just any type of data.
#a tuple is the same as a list except it is imutable
#Indexing is a way of numbering the things in a list or tuple but it always starts from 0.
#Mutability is the ability of being editable
#Immutability is the ability of being only being able to be edited withing the code the code that made the immutable thing.
#2.
#The difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable and a tuple is IMmutable.
#3. 
#how indexing works is numbering the place of the data within lists and tuples. It starts from 0 and apparently goes to the end of the list if you put negative 1.it shows an error when you put a positive number out of the range of the list or tuple.

listee = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,]
listee.append(10)
listee.remove(5)
listee[9] = 100
print (listee)
#5.
tup = ("icee", "myy")
tup.append ("error")
tupp = ('icethee', 'mwy')
tuup = tup + tupp
print (tuup)

#There are many different ways lists and tuples can be compared.
#First, lists and tuples are the same because the code to make them are the same excempt for that a list is made with brakets and tuples are made with parenthses.
#Second, lists and tuples are also the same because
