#And "It is True" wouldn't make sense because it doesn't say WHAT'S true.
#3.
#age contains data that says what the user typed in the console.
#frstname, Midname,and Last_name together say what the three variables contain in the order in which they are typed in line 97.
#temp contains data that explains what temperature is IN DECIMALS.
#SunnyOverll contains a boolean that tells us (true or false) if at least ONE of Sunny_yes or Sunny_no is true.
