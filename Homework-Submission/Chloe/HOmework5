#A list is a group of srung together strings, integers, flats, or just any type of data.
#a tuple is the same as a list except it is imutable
#Indexing is a way of numbering the things in a list or tuple but it always starts from 0.
#Mutability is the ability of being editable

#The difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable and a tuple is IMmutable.
#3. 
#how indexing works is numbering the place of the data within lists and tuples. It starts from 0 and apparently goes to the end of the list if you put negative 1.it shows an error when you put a positive number out of the range of the list or tuple.
