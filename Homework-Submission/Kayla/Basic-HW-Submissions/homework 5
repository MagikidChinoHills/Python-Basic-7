#List: Data structures in Python that allow you to store collections of data/values#
#Tuple: Basiclaly lists but uses () instead of []
#Indexing: a way of numbering your list that starts from zero
#Mutability: Elements can be changed after creation
#Immutability: Elements can not be changed after creation

#lists are mutable which means it can be chnaged after creation and tuples can not be changed because it is immutable.

#List and tuple indexing is where they start at a base of zero. For example, if there was a list of [1, 2, 3], number 1 would be recognized as 0.




#Problem 1:
int_list=[3, 6, 8, 8, 9]
int_list.append(0)
int_list.remove(3)
int_list[4]=1
print(int_list)

#Problem 2:
fruits=("banana", "coconut", "cherry", "lemon")
tuple2=("potatoes", "apples", "mango")
final_tuple= fruits + tuple2
print(final_tuple)



#Problem 3:
#Lists and tuples are two diffrent data types in python. some similarities are the base zero rule.
#They also store data inside them. Diffrences are that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.
