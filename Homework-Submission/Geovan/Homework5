#List: Data strutures in Python that allow you to store collections of data/values
#Tuple: a type of list that can't be edited
# Indexing: a way of numbering your list that starts from 0
#Mutability: a list and what it is AFTER being changed
#Immutability: a list that CAN'T be changed, like a Tuple

#Tuple can't be changed
#Lists: can be changed

#List use
Color_list=["Red","Orange","Yellow"," Green","Seven"]
Color_list.remove("Seven")
Color_list.append("Blue")
print(Color_list)
#You might need to add something or remove something without changing the code of the list entirely

#Tuple uses
#When you want to make sure you don't change something unintetionally.
#Indexing can be used to change a List and Print a certian value in a tuple


#Ex:
List = ["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansaw","Colorado","Coneticut"]
State_4 = List[3]
print(State_4)
LIST = (123,456,789,101112)
Cut_list = LIST[2:4]# <-- index
print(Cut_list)

#Prob 1
List1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
List1.append(8)
List1.remove(1)
List1[4] = 3
print(List1)

#prob 2
tuple2 = ("Rabbit", "Frog", "Bee")
tuple2.remove(2)
tuple1 = ("Cat","Dog","Horse")
w = tuple1[0]
print(w)

Tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

#Fixed version
tuple2 = ("Rabbit", "Frog", "Bee")
tuple1 = ("Cat","Dog","Horse")
w = tuple1[0]
print(w)

Tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)
