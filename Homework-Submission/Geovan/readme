#Problem 1
My_Age = 11
My_Name = "Geovan Zheng"
Tempature = 78.4
Sunny = False

print("My age is", My_Age)
print("My name is", My_Name)
print("The tempature outside is", Tempature, "degrees")
print("It is sunny:", Sunny)

#The age variable is a int value becausee it has a whole number with no decimal
#The name variable is a string because it contains characters
#The tempature variable is a float because it contains decimals
#The sunny variable is a boolean because it is true or false

#When I print a certian variable, it prints out the letters, numbers, or words that where contained inside of them.

#Problem 2
