#Problem 1
My_Age = 11
My_Name = "Geovan Zheng"
Temperature = 78.4
Sunny = False

print("My age is", My_Age)
print("My name is", My_Name)
print("The temperature outside is", Temperature, "degrees")
print("It is sunny:", Sunny)

#The My_Age variable is an int value because it has a whole number with no decimal
#The My_Name variable is a string because it contains characters
#The Temperature variable is a float because it contains decimals
#The Sunny variable is a boolean because it is true or false

#When I print a certain variable, it prints out the letters, numbers, or words that is contained inside the variable.

#Problem 2

Age = input("How old are you? ")
Old = int(Age)
print("\nYou are", Old ,"years old.")

#The Age variable will store the inputted value
#The Old variable will turn the Age variable into an int value.
#The print command will print out the Old variable.

temperature = input("What is the temperature in celcius?")
celcius = float(temperature)
fahrenheit = float((celcius * 9/5) + 32)
print("\nThe temperature is",  celcius, "°C or", fahrenheit, "°F.")

#The temperature variable will store the inputted value.
#The celcius variable will turn the temperature variable into a float value.
#The fahrenheit variable will calculate the celcius value into a fahrenheit value.
#The print command will print out the celcius and fahrenheit variable.
